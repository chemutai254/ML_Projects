In this case scenario, we are implememnting it as part of the feature engineering process, in order to aid us obtaim nore insights from our data\n","\n","For this class simulation/ Case study , we will use the pca for feature decomposition and kmeans as a clustering algorithm, please feel free to research and test implememnt 'other' decomposition algortihms listed above and other clustering algorithms explored above too, compare the performances and you can decide to stick with a combination that suits
